# Weather API Proxy Server

## Description

Weather API Proxy Server is a lightweight PHP server designed to act as a proxy for securely interacting with external APIs, such as OpenWeatherMap and Ipify. This server hides API keys, ensuring they are not exposed to the client-side, and handles all API requests securely. It supports CORS for cross-origin requests and allows for easy integration with frontend applications.

## Features

- **Proxy Server**: Handles requests to the OpenWeatherMap and Ipify APIs, ensuring API keys are not exposed.
- **CORS Support**: Allows cross-origin requests, making it easy to integrate with frontend applications.
- **Simple Setup**: Easy to deploy with minimal configuration.
- **Secure API Interaction**: Protects sensitive API keys by processing all requests server-side.

## Technologies Used

- PHP
- cURL
- OpenWeatherMap API
- Ipify API

## Usage

This server is designed for personal use only and restricts access to specific weather data endpoints. If you wish to use a similar setup, you can clone this repository and deploy your own instance.

To replicate this setup, clone the repository, configure your API keys, and host the server on your own domain or local environment.
